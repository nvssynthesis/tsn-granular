tsn-granular is the timbre space navigation (TSN)-enabled version on slicer-granular. It contains all of the capabilities of slicer-granular, with the main addition that it analyzes the uploaded sample, splitting it into smaller segments via onset detection, and organizes these segments into an interactive multidimensional timbre space.
